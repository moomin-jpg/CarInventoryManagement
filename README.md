# CarInventoryManagement
This C# program allows the user to view, add to, and remove from a car inventory that is locally stored in a .JSON database. This program is aimed towards car dealership employees who wish to manage and keep track of stock as cars roll in and out of the lot.
## Installation and Operation
1. On the repository page, click the green Code button and clone the project using the remote URL or download it as a zip. Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio installed, you may click "Open with Visual Studio", where it will automatically clone and open the repository in the IDE.
2. Open the solution file, which is CarInventoryManagement.sln (If you chose to open with Visual Studio, it should already have opened.)
3. In the solution explorer, select CarInventoryManagement.cs, and hit F5 to run the program.
